In the Spotlight:
Storing Names and Birthdays in a Dictionary
In this section we look at a program that keeps your friends’ names and birthdays in a dictionary.
Each entry in the dictionary uses a friend’s name as the key and that friend’s birthday
as the value. You can use the program to look up your friends’ birthdays by entering
their names.
The program displays a menu that allows the user to make one of the following choices:
1. Look up a birthday
2. Add a new birthday
3. Change a birthday
4. Delete a birthday
5. Quit the program
The program initially starts with an empty dictionary, so you have to choose item 2 from
the menu to add a new entry. Once you have added a few entries, you can choose item 1 to
look up a specific person’s birthday, item 3 to change an existing birthday in the dictionary,
item 4 to delete a birthday from the dictionary, or item 5 to quit the program.
Program 10-2 shows the program code. The program is divided into six functions: main,
get_menu_choice, look_up, add, change, and delete. Rather than presenting the entire
program at once, let’s first examine the global constants and the main function:
"""
# Glogal constant variables
LOOK_UP = 1
ADD = 2
CHANGE = 3
DELETE = 4
SHOW = 5
QUIT = 6

	user_input = int(input("Please enter a value between 1 and 6: "))
	# create a while loop that runs as long as the user inputs the right input(between 1 and 5)
	while ((user_input < LOOK_UP) or (user_input > QUIT)):
