Programming Exercises
1. Course information
Write a program that creates a dictionary containing course numbers and the room numbers
of the rooms where the courses meet. The dictionary should have the following keyvalue
pairs:
Course Number (key)			 Room Number (value)
CS101 						3004
CS102 						4501
CS103 						6755
NT110 						1244
CM241 						1411
The program should also create a dictionary containing course numbers and the names of
the instructors that teach each course. The dictionary should have the following key-value
pairs:
Course Number (key)			Instructor (value)
CS101 						Haynes
CS102 						Alvarado
CS103 						Rich
NT110 						Burke
CM241 						Lee
The program should also create a dictionary containing course numbers and the meeting
times of each course. The dictionary should have the following key-value pairs:
Course Number (key) 		Meeting Time (value)
CS101 						8:00 a.m.
CS102 						9:00 a.m.
CS103 						10:00 a.m.
NT110 						11:00 a.m.
CM241 						1:00 p.m.
The program should let the user enter a course number, and then it should display the
courseâ€™s room number, instructor, and meeting time.
