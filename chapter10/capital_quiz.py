Programming Exercises
2. Capital Quiz
Write a program that creates a dictionary containing the canadian provinces and territories
as keys and their capitals as values. The program should then randomly quiz the user by displaying 
the name of a state and asking the user to enter that stateâ€™s capital. The program should keep 
a count of the number of correct and incorrect responses.
