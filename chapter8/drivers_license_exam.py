Programming Exercises
6. Driver’s License Exam
The local driver’s license office has asked you to create an application that grades the written portion 
of the driver’s license exam. The exam has 20 multiple-choice questions. Here are the correct answers:
1. B 
2. D 
3. A 
4. A 
5. C
6. A
7. B 
8. A 
9. C 
10. D
11. B 
12. C 
13. D 
14. A 
15. D
16. C 
17. C 
18. B 
19. D 
20. A
Your program should store these correct answers in a list. The program should read the student’s answers 
for each of the 20 questions from a text file and store the answers in another list. (Create your own text file 
to test the application.) After the student’s answers have been read from the file, the program should display a 
message indicating whether the student passed or failed the exam. (A student must correctly answer 15 of the 20 
questions to pass the exam.) It should then display the total number of correctly answered questions, the total 
number of incorrectly answered questions, and a list showing the question numbers of the incorrectly answered questions.
