In the Spotlight:
Processing a List
Dr. LaClaire gives a series of exams during the semester in her chemistry class. At the end of the semester
she drops each student’s lowest test score before averaging the scores. She has asked you to design a program 
that will read a student’s test scores as input, and cal- culate the average with the lowest score dropped. 
Here is the algorithm that you developed:
Get the student’s test scores.
Calculate the total of the scores.
Find the lowest score.
Subtract the lowest score from the total. This gives the adjusted total.
Divide the adjusted total by 1 less than the number of test scores. This is the average. Display the average.
