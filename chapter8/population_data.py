Programming Exercises
8. Population Data
If you have downloaded the source code from this book’s companion Web site, you will find a file named 
USPopulation.txt in the Chapter 08 folder. The file contains the midyear
population of the United States, in thousands, during the years 1950 through 1990. 
The first line in the file contains the population for 1950, the second line contains the popula- tion for 1951, and so forth.
Write a program that reads the file’s contents into a list. The program should display the following data:
• The average annual change in population during the time period
• The year with the greatest increase in population during the time period
• The year with the smallest increase in population during the time period
