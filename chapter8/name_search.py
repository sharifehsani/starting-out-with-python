Programming Exercises
7. Name Search
If you have downloaded the source code from this book’s companion Web site, you will find the 
following files in the Chapter 08 folder:
• GirlNames.txt—This file contains a list of the 200 most popular names given to girls born in 
  the United States from the year 2000 through 2009.
• BoyNames.txt—This file contains a list of the 200 most popular names given to boys born in the 
  United States from the year 2000 through 2009.
Write a program that reads the contents of the two files into two separate lists. The user should be able to enter a 
boy’s name, a girl’s name, or both, and the application will display messages indicating whether the names were among the most popular.
(You can access the book’s companion Web site at www.pearsonhighered.com/gaddis.)
