4. Distance Traveled
The distance a vehicle travels can be calculated as follows:
distance = speed x time
For example, if a train travels 40 km per hour for three hours, the distance traveled is 120
km. Write a program that asks the user for the speed of a vehicle (in km per hour) and
the number of hours it has traveled. It should then use a loop to display the distance the
vehicle has traveled for each hour of that time period. Here is an example of the desired
output:
What is the speed of the vehicle in mph? 40
How many hours has it traveled? 3
Hour Distance Traveled
1 40
2 80
3 120
