10. Monthly Sales Tax
A retail company must file a monthly sales tax report listing the total sales for the month,
and the amount of state and county sales tax collected. The state sales tax rate is 4 percent
and the county sales tax rate is 2 percent. Write a program that asks the user to enter the
total sales for the month. From this figure, the application should calculate and display the
following:
• The amount of county sales tax
• The amount of state sales tax
• The total sales tax (county plus state)
