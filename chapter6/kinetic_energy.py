5. Kinetic Energy
In physics, an object that is in motion is said to have kinetic energy (KE). The following formula
can be used to determine a moving object’s kinetic energy:
KE = 1⁄2 mv^2
The variables in the formula are as follows: KE is the kinetic energy in joules, m is the
object’s mass in kilograms, and v is the object’s velocity in meters per second.
Write a function named kinetic_energy that accepts an object’s mass in kilograms and
velocity in meters per second as arguments. The function should return the amount of
kinetic energy that the object has. Write a program that asks the user to enter values for
mass and velocity, and then calls the kinetic_energy function to get the object’s kinetic
energy.
