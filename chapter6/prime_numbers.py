8. Prime Numbers
A prime number is a number that is only evenly divisible by itself and 1. For example, the
number 5 is prime because it can only be evenly divided by 1 and 5. The number 6, however,
is not prime because it can be divided evenly by 1, 2, 3, and 6.
Write a Boolean function named is_prime which takes an integer as an argument and
returns True if the argument is a prime number, or False otherwise. Use the function in a
program that prompts the user to enter a number and then displays a message indicating
whether the number is prime.
