6. Test Average and Grade
Write a program that asks the user to enter five test scores. The program should display a letter
grade for each score and the average test score. Write the following functions in the program:
• calc_average—This function should accept five test scores as arguments and return
the average of the scores.
• determine_grade—This function should accept a test score as an argument and
return a letter grade for the score, based on the following grading scale:
Score Letter Grade
90–100 A
80–89 B
70–79 C
60–69 D
Below 60 F
