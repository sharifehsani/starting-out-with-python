1. Roman Numerals
Write a program that prompts the user to enter a number within the range of 1 through 10.
The program should display the Roman numeral version of that number. If the number is
outside the range of 1 through 10, the program should display an error message. The following
table shows the Roman numerals for the numbers 1 through 10:
Number Roman Numeral
1 ---> I
2 ---> II
3 ---> III
4 ---> IV
5 ---> V
6 ---> VI
7 ---> VII
8 ---> VIII
9 ---> IX
10 ---> X
