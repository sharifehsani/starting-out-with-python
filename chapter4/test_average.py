Using the if Statement
Kathryn teaches a science class and her students are required to take three tests. She wants
to write a program that her students can use to calculate their average test score. She also
wants the program to congratulate the student enthusiastically if the average is greater than
95. Here is the algorithm in pseudocode:
Get the first test score
Get the second test score
Get the third test score
Calculate the average
Display the average
If the average is greater than 95:
Congratulate the user
