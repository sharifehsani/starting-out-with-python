In the Spotlight:
Validating the Characters in a Password
At the university, passwords for the campus computer system must meet the following
requirements:
• The password must be at least seven characters long.
• It must contain at least one uppercase letter.
• It must contain at least one lowercase letter.
• It must contain at least one numeric digit.
When a student sets up his or her password, the password must be validated to ensure it
meets these requirements. You have been asked to write the code that performs this validation.
You decide to write a function named valid_password that accepts the password as
an argument and returns either true or false, to indicate whether it is valid. Here is the algorithm
for the function, in pseudocode:
valid_password function:
Set the correct_length variable to false
Set the has_uppercase variable to false
Set the has_lowercase variable to false
Set the has_digit variable to false
If the password’s length is seven characters or greater:
Set the correct_length variable to true
for each character in the password:
if the character is an uppercase letter:
Set the has_uppercase variable to true
if the character is a lowercase letter:
Set the has_lowercase variable to true
if the character is a digit:
Set the has_digit variable to true
If correct_length and has_uppercase and has_lowercase and has_digit:
Set the is_valid variable to true
else:
Set the is_valid variable to false
Return the is_valid variable
Earlier (in the previous In the Spotlight section) you created a function named
get_login_name, and stored that function in the login module. Because the valid_password
function’s purpose is related to the task of creating a student’s login account, you
decide to store the valid_password function in the login module as well. Program 9-6
shows the login module with the valid_password function added to it.
