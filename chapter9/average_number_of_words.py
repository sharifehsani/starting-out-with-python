6. Average Number of Words
If you have downloaded the source code from this book’s companion Web site, you will
find a file named text.txt in the Chapter 09 folder. The text that is in the file is stored
as one sentence per line. Write a program that reads the file’s contents and calculates the
average number of words per sentence.
(You can access the book’s companion Web site at www.pearsonhighered.com/gaddis.)
