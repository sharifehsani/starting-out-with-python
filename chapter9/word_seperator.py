11. Word Separator
Write a program that accepts as input a sentence in which all of the words are run together
but the first character of each word is uppercase. Convert the sentence to a string in which
the words are separated by spaces and only the first word starts with an uppercase letter. For
example the string “StopAndSmellTheRoses.” would be converted to “Stop and smell the
roses.”
