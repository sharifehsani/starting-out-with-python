9. Vowels and Consonants
Write a program with a function that accepts a string as an argument and returns the number
of vowels that the string contains. The application should have another function that accepts a string as an argument
and returns the number of consonants that the string contains.
The application should let the user enter a string and should display the number of
vowels and the number of consonants it contains.
