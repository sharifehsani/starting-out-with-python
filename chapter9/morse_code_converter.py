4. Morse Code Converter
Morse code is a code where each letter of the English alphabet, each digit, and various
punctuation characters are represented by a series of dots and dashes. Table 9-5 shows part
of the code.
Write a program that asks the user to enter a string, and then converts that string to Morse
code.
